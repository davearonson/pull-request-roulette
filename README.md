pull-request-roulette
=====================

Web app to match up developers with people willing to comment on their pull requests.

The MVP:
- Github users (coders) ask for someone to review a pull request they have made.  The review-request goes into a queue.
- Github users (reviewers) volunteer to review a pull request.  They get the next one off the queue.

Possible features saved for later:
- Notify coder of reviewer volunteering.  (How?)
- Let reviewers rate the code, and coders rate the review.
- Accumulate these ratings onto profiles.  (Don't show until at least three ratings have been accumulated, to anonymize.)
- Keep a list of pending reviews, for reminders or reposting (in case the reviewer just doesn't do it).
- Process guidelines, such as "I'm done" notification?
- Let each side specify minimum rating for the other side to match.  (Premium feature?)
- Make it work with *private* repos.  (Premium feature?)
- Let reviewers say "I'll be available for next X hours", and let *premium* coders choose from a list of who's available.

This line is just to make sure there is a difference from master in this
branch.  The pull request based on this branch should never be closed, because
it serves as an example of an open pull request, for the tests.
