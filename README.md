pull-request-roulette
=====================

Web app to match up developers with people willing to comment on their pull requests.

The MVP:
- Github users (coders) ask for someone to review a pull request they have made.  The review-request goes into a queue.
- Github users (reviewers) volunteer to review a pull request.  They get the next one off the queue.

Possible features saved for later:
- Notify coder of reviewer volunteering.  (How?)
- Let reviewers rate the code, and coders rate the review.
- Accumulate these ratings onto profiles.  (Don't show until at least three ratings have been accumulated, to anonymize.)
- Keep a list of pending reviews, for reminders or reposting (in case the reviewer just doesn't do it).
- Process guidelines, such as "I'm done" notification?
- Let each side specify minimum rating for the other side to match.  (Premium feature?)
- Make it work with *private* repos.  (Premium feature?)
- Let reviewers say "I'll be available for next X hours", and let *premium* coders choose from a list of who's available.
