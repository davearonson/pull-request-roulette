<h1>Welcome to Pull Request Roulette!</h1>

<p>Below is a table of pull requests (or PRs) submitted for review, belonging
to open-source projects hosted on Github.&nbsp; Click on a URL to open it in a
new tab or window.&nbsp; Click Take to commit to reviewing that PR.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Please take this commitment seriously!&nbsp; It takes the PR out of the
list, so nobody else can take it.&nbsp; If for whatever reason you can't review
it in a timely manner, please put it back in the list.&nbsp; You can do this by
submitting it just as if it were a brand-new submission.</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="5">
  <tbody>
    <% if @pull_requests.any? %>
      <% @pull_requests.each do |pull_request| %>
        <tr>
          <td><%= link_to pull_request.url, pull_request.url, target: '_new' %></td>
          <td><%= link_to 'Take', pull_request, method: :delete,

<p>This is a public service of <%= link_to('Codosaurus, LLC',

<p>Note:&nbsp; Yes, I know, it looks like garbage.&nbsp; This is just the MVP,
which hasn't been styled at all.&nbsp; Even as I improve it, I'll be focusing
mainly on the functionality; feel free to lend me a hand with the looks.</p>
