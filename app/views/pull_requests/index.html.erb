<h1>Welcome to Pull Request Roulette!</h1>

<p>Below is a table of pull requests (or PRs) submitted for review, belonging
to open-source projects hosted on Github.&nbsp; (User is the project owner, not
the creator of the PR.)&nbsp; Click Open open it in a new tab or window.&nbsp;
Click Take to commit to reviewing that PR.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Please take this commitment seriously!&nbsp; It takes the PR out of the
list, so nobody else can take it.&nbsp; If for whatever reason you can't review
it in a timely manner, please put it back in the list.&nbsp; You can do this by
submitting it just as if it were a brand-new submission.</p>

<p>Note:&nbsp; Yes, I know, it looks like garbage.&nbsp; This is just the MVP,
which hasn't been styled at all.&nbsp; Even as I improve it, I'll be focusing
mainly on the functionality; feel free to lend me a hand with the looks.</p>
